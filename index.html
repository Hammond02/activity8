                    Canvas offers discussion boards for asynchronous discussions, chat rooms for live discussions,
                    centralized email (Canvas Conversations), so you can stay in touch with your instructor and
                    communicate with other students, and even a way to submit assignments and take exams. Canvas
                    provides you with a password-protected online classroom in which you will submit your work and
                    communicate with your instructor and classmates.</p>

                    Google Classroom is a suite of online tools that allows teachers to set assignments, have work
                    submitted by students, to mark, and to return graded papers. It, effectively, was created as a way
                    to get rid of paper in classes and to make digital learning possible. As more schools have
                    transitioned to online learning, Google Classroom has got far wider use as teachers quickly
                    implement paperless instruction. </p>

                    <p>Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing service you can use to virtually meet with others -
                        either by video or audio-only or both, all while conducting live chats - and it lets you record
                        those sessions to view later. You
                        can join these meetings via a webcam or phone. Zoom allows one-to-one chat sessions that can
                        grow into group calls, training sessions and webinars for internal and external audiences, and
                        global video meetings with up to 1,000 participants and as many as 49 on-screen videos. The free
                        tier allows unlimited one-on-one meetings but limits group sessions to 40 minutes and 100
                        participants. Paid plans start at $15 per month per host.</p>

                    <p>If you game, you might already be familiar with Discord. Discord is a chat platform that
                        initially grew out of gaming communities. There are chat spaces — called “servers” — dedicated
                        to just about anything. There are servers for work, for play and for learning.

                        In spring 2020, with teachers looking to meet their students where they were — that is, chatting
                        with friends online — classroom Discord servers were created. More and more educators began
                        looking at using Discord as a place to learn as much as hang out. A year later, Discord is still
                        an option for virtual classrooms and group gatherings.</p>

                    <p>Google Meet is a video conferencing service from Google. It's a great solution for both
                        individuals and businesses to meet on audio and video calls. It was born from Google Hangouts,Google Meet is primarily designed as a way to host video meetings. However, you can enable the camera and microphone independently, so you can just use it for audio calls if you wish.

                        You can create ad hoc calls and invite your friends and family. They can join by typing your meeting code or you can send them a link that they click on.
                        
                        One of the best things about Google Meet is that you don't need to install any software on desktop.</p>
